# UCF-Programming-Language-project
4 languages learned from this course: Haskell, JavaScript/TypeScript, C++, C#.
This contains every assignments and tests I had that solve some basic problems to train skills on programming. 
Highly recommend you to take Dr. Leinecker's Programming Langugage course if you are a UCF Knights. Have a Paradise every class!
